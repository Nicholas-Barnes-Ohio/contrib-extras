Mounting kit for the [EVA v2](https://eva-3d.github.io/eva-main/) on the [BLV MGN Cube printer](https://www.blvprojects.com/blv-mgn-cube-3d-printer).

The standard EVA hotend carriage was designed for printers using 9mm belts with a different orientation than the BLV MGN Cube. This kit provides all the parts needed to use the EVA on the BLV MGN Cube.

| 3  | 1   | Modified Trihorn Cooler                           | [Yes](stl/blv-mgn-cube-back_corexy.stl) |

The kit only supports hotends and extruders that are compatible with the original universal face (e.g. not the Titan Aero, which has a dedicated face). It also only supports stock Ender 6 10mm timing belts.
